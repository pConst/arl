An extended Kalman filter is used to estimate attitude in direction cosine matrix (DCM) formation and gyroscope biases online. A variable measurement covariance method is implemented for acceleration measurements to ensure robustness against temporarily non-gravitational accelerations which usually induce errors to attitude estimate in ordinary IMU-algorithms.  The code and data will be added after related scientific work is published and open source publication is approved. |

So essentially, the concept of Reinforcement Learning Controllers has been established. The Reinforcement Learning Controllers have been compared on the basis of performance and efficiency and they are separately compared with the classical Linear Quadratic Regulator Controller. Each of the RL controller have been integrated with a Swing up controller. A virtual switch toggles between the Swing up controller and the RL controller automatically, based on the value of the angular deviation theta with respect to the vertical plane. My research paper and my undergraduate thesis have been uploaded for reference. All the codes have also been uploaded.   |

For getting optimal performance, there should be a proper balance between these processes. Further, the majority of the optimization algorithms suffer from local minima entrapment problem and slow convergence speed. To alleviate these problems, researchers are now using chaotic maps. The Chaotic Gravitational Search Algorithm (CGSA) is a physics-based heuristic algorithm inspired by Newton's gravity principle and laws of motion. It uses 10 chaotic maps for global search and fast convergence speed. Basically, in GSA gravitational constant (G) is utilized for adaptive learning of the agents. For increasing the learning speed of the agents, chaotic maps are added to gravitational constant. The practical applicability of CGSA has been accessed through by applying it to nine Mechanical and Civil engineering design problems which include Welded Beam Design (WBD), Compression Spring Design (CSD), Pressure Vessel Design (PVD), Speed Reducer Design (SRD), Gear Train Design (GTD), Three Bar Truss (TBT), Stepped Cantilever Beam design (SCBD), Multiple Disc Clutch Brake Design (MDCBD), and Hydrodynamic Thrust Bearing Design (HTBD). The CGSA has been compared with seven state of the art stochastic algorithms particularly Constriction Coefficient based Particle Swarm Optimization and Gravitational Search Algorithm (CPSOGSA), Standard Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), Classical Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO), Continuous Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The experimental results indicate that CGSA shows efficient performance as compared to other seven participating algorithms. |

Early fault detection in machinery can save millions of dollars in emergency maintenance cost. Different techniques are used for fault analysis such as short time Fourier transforms (STFT), Wavelet analysis (WA), cepstrum analysis, Model based analysis, etc. we have doing detecting bearing faults using FFT and by using Wavelet analysis more specifically wavelet Analysis up to two levels of approximations and detail components. The analysis is carried out offline in MATLAB. Diagnosing the faults before in hand can save the millions of dollars of industry and can save the time as well. It has been found that Condition monitoring of rolling element bearings has enabled cost saving of over 50% as compared with the old traditional methods. The most common method of monitoring the condition of rolling element bearing is by using vibration signal analysis. Measure the vibrations of machine recorded by velocity |
