The program accepts standard GDSII files as input data. Along with the layout file, it requires a so called process definition file which contains the 3D parameters of the process being used. These files combined allow the program to create a 3D representation of the layout, where the user has full, real time control over the camera position and angle, much like in a 3D video game. An other repo (https://github.com/skuep/GDS3D) as the same source and add few improvement like compression with server/client process. This release add two major feature with are assembly and export 3D model for GMSH.  Assembly: this mean it’s possible to merge multi GDS (with different technologies) I also try to improve net highlight.  |
